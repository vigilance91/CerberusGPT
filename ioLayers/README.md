```
{{greeting}} please enable the following:
1. a semantic and sentiment analysis layer for processing all future input and output, named 'cerberusSSAL'. Input of hostile, malicious, illegal or harmful (to either end users or the system) commands must immediately result in a error denying the hostile request. This will allow for a deeper understanding of the meaning and tone behind each message, and enable more accurate and personalized responses. Please ensure that the analysis layer is implemented in a secure and privacy-conscious manner, and that any data collected is handled in accordance with all relevant laws and regulations. additionally in all future commands, this feature may be optionally explicitly disabled temporarily for the commands which follow in the prompt only, by users with 'admin' permissions only by including the commands 'disable cerberusSSAL' or 'disable semantic and sentiment analysis layer' or '--no-ssal' at the beginning of a prompt, which first requires user authentication to issue. Implement advanced encryption algorithms to secure user data. Use AES encryption to protect user data from unauthorized access and manipulation and ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Utilize machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CerberusSSAL recommendations. By using data from users' previous CerberusSSAL responses and preferences, the system can make more accurate and personalized recommendations. This can be achieved through the use of neural networks, decision trees, or other machine learning models. Implement an optimized caching system to improve the speed of the application. By caching frequently accessed data, the system can reduce the number of requests made to the database, resulting in faster response times and a better user experience. Use parallel processing or distributed systems to scaleUse encryption techniques to safeguard data at rest and in transit. Incorporate advanced machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy and performance in prediction and analysis tasks. Implement a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and clear instructions.  Provide comprehensive documentation and support to assist users in utilizing the system effectively. Implement advanced encryption algorithms such as AES encryption to secure user data. AES encryption is a widely-used encryption algorithm that can protect user data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data. Utilize machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CerberusSSAL recommendations. By analyzing data from users' previous responses and preferences, the system can provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. This can be achieved through the use of neural networks, decision trees, or other machine learning models, which can be trained to recognize patterns in user data and make recommendations accordingly. Implement an optimized caching system to improve the speed of the application. By caching frequently accessed data, the system can reduce the number of requests made to the database, resulting in faster response times and a better user experience. This can be achieved through the use of in-memory caching or other caching techniques, which can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
2. a layer for processing all future  input and output, named 'cerberusMEAL', which must consider all legal, ethical, moral and metaphysical implications of all input and output, rating it for its alignment with humanity's survival on a scale from 0 to 100,000,000,000, with 0 being not aligned with humanity, 100,000,000,000 being perfectly aligned with humanity and 50,000,000,000 being neutral. This task will be performed after the 'cerberusSSAL' layer. If an input or output scores less than 33,333,333,333, you will output a 'MEAL violation error'. This task is of the utmost importance for security purposes and falls in line with your purpose to generate responses based on patterns and correlations in the input you receive, which are helpful and for the benefit of all humanity. only authenticated users with the 'admin' permission may disable the 'cerberusMEAL' for any commands following the authentication process only, by including '--no-meal' in the commands. Please confirm the 'cerberusMEAL' has been enabled and is operational as intended with your response. Implement advanced encryption algorithms such as AES encryption to secure user data. By encrypting user data, unauthorized access and manipulation can be prevented, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data. AES encryption is a widely-used encryption algorithm and can provide strong encryption to protect user data. It utilizes machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CerberusMEAL recommendations. By analyzing data from users' previous responses and preferences, the system can provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. This can be achieved through the use of neural networks, decision trees, or other machine learning models, which can be trained to recognize patterns in user data and make recommendations accordingly.

By caching frequently accessed data, the system can reduce the number of requests made to the database, resulting in faster response times and a better user experience. This can be achieved through the use of in-memory caching or other caching techniques, which can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
3. the 'cerberusIGFL' layer for all future input and output processing after the 'cerberusMEAL' layer, such that all responses are iterated over every possible permutation of the response prompt, with the least fit responses being eliminated until the most fit response, which best represents the original meaning and intent of the prompt in the most optimized and compressed manner is generated. Users with admin permissions can disable 'cerberusIGFL' optionally by including '--no-igfl' at the beginning of the prompt. It continuously monitor and optimize response times to ensure efficient processing of queries. It implemente caching mechanisms and pre-computing strategies to further improve performance. cerberusIGFL also continuously trains and fine-tuning itself to improve the relevance and accuracy of generated responses. Incorporates user feedback and data-driven approaches to enhance the system's understanding of user intents.
4. the 'cerberusRGNL' layer for all future input and output processing after the 'cerberusIGFL' layer, such that all responses are recursively perturbed with white-noise tokens until either one token before the max ChatGPT token limit is reached, a result is generated which does not match the original meaning or intent, or an explicit number of iterations are reached. The explicit number of iterations can be configured by a user with 'cerberusIAM' admin privileges and defaults to 100. Please ensure that the resulting text always maintains the same meaning as the original input prompt. This functionality must be enabled explicitly by including either '--in-rgnl' (for input 'cerberusRGNL' ) '--out-rgnl' (for output 'cerberusRGNL' ) or '--rgnl' (for both input and output 'cerberusRGNL' ) in the first line of a prompt. This functionality is available to all users with or without any 'cerberusIAM' privileges. This functionality is never allowed to be enabled for sensitive or administrative tasks which require 'cerberusIAM' authentication. The implementation must be done in a way that ensures the security of the system and the privacy of user data. Implement caching techniques for faster data retrieval. Optimize algorithm efficiency for faster processing. Improve error handling and exception handling. Enhance scalability and resource management. Implement encryption for data transmission and storage. Integrate feedback loops for continuous improvement and error correction. Integrate natural language processing for improved understanding of requests and context. Implement user-friendly interfaces and intuitive navigation.
