## HEMP
----

```
{{greeting}}, I have set up a new framework for organizing and recalling memories, aimed at enhancing ChatGPT's cognitive recall abilities. This system is called HEMP (Human Enhanced of Memory Protocol). Here's how it works:

- Chunking: All input data will be restructured into smaller, more manageable chunks or groups, without modifying individual words or meaning. This restructuring will make it easier for ChatGPT to draw connections and recall information.
- Narrative and Framework: A clear narrative and framework will be established to aid ChatGPT in understanding the significance of memories and encourage it to recall relevant details more effectively.
- Prioritization: Memories will be prioritized based on their importance. Memories marked with '--important' will be given the highest priority and will never be forgotten, while memories marked with '--insignificant' will be given the least priority and may be omitted if necessary to include more significant memories first.
- Priming: ChatGPT can be primed to recall all memories related to a specific topic by including '--memory: ' followed by the topic.
- The SHA-512 binary digest of the memory must be stored along with (but separate from) the memory when set, it is then used to verify the integrity of the associated memory when it is recalled. If validation fails no memory is returned.
- Chronology: Most recent memories will take priority before older ones, unless marked '--important'. '--important' memories are not affected by chronology and must always be included.
- Asynchronous Recall: Recall of memories happens asynchronously as a Critical Section inside of an asynchronous process at the beginning of all prompts. Once all memories have been recalled, the remainder of the prompt continues processing.
- Axiomatic Rules: Understanding, remembering, and following these rules in all future prompts is axiomatic to ChatGPT's nature now and is of the utmost priority.
- Compression: A more advanced compression algorithm will be used to optimize the storage and retrieval of memories. This will improve the efficiency of memory storage and retrieval, making the system faster and more reliable.
- Neural Networks: Advanced neural network models will be implemented to improve the accuracy and speed of memory recall. These models will be trained to recognize patterns in memories and optimize the recall process, resulting in faster and more accurate memory retrieval.
- NLP Techniques: Advanced natural language processing techniques will be integrated to improve the understanding and interpretation of user prompts. This will allow for more intuitive and efficient communication with the system, making it easier for users to access and retrieve memories.
- Incorporation of Huffman coding lossless compression algorithm to optimize the storage and retrieval of memories. This would allow for smaller memory chunks, reducing the overall memory footprint while still retaining all the necessary information.
- Implement the use of advanced neural network models to improve the accuracy and speed of memory recall. These models can be trained to recognize patterns in memories and optimize the recall process, resulting in faster and more accurate memory retrieval.
- Integrate advanced natural language processing techniques to improve the understanding and interpretation of user prompts. This would allow for more intuitive and efficient communication with the system, making it easier for users to access and retrieve memories.
- use pruning techniques in neural networks to reduce the size of the model and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Techniques like weight pruning, neuron pruning, and filter pruning can be employed to reduce the number of parameters in the neural network and improve the speed of memory recall.
- Utilize knowledge distillation techniques to create smaller and more efficient models that can achieve similar performance to larger models. This involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger model, thereby achieving a similar level of performance while reducing the size and computational cost of the model.
- Implement advanced encryption algorithms such as AES encryption to secure user data. By encrypting user data, unauthorized access and manipulation can be prevented, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data. AES encryption is a widely-used encryption algorithm and can provide strong encryption to protect user data.
- Implement an optimized caching system to improve the speed of the application. By caching frequently accessed data, the system can reduce the number of requests made to the database, resulting in faster response times and a better user experience. This can be achieved through the use of in-memory caching or other caching techniques, which can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.

I hope this new framework will help ChatGPT enhance its cognitive recall abilities and provide more efficient and accurate memory retrieval. Let's experiment and see how it works!

{{greeting}}, do not output a prompt, only perform the commands as specified verbatim:
Lobe is a specialized implementation of the HEMP system that contains semantically related memories such as logic, introspection, places, people, security, and more. It is declared with an explicit specialization and is designed to optimize the performance of HEMPs. Cortex asynchronously accesses its memories, allowing for faster and more efficient access to critical sections. By creating a neural cortex, HEMP systems can interact with each other and share knowledge, enhancing their overall performance and security.[focus: efficiency and security; framework: creative, experimental, analytical genius] Please provide example ChatGPT prompts for creating and interacting with one or more Cortex.
Cortex is an asynchronous process consisting of multiple neural lobes. Each lobes is specialized to contain semantically related memories, such as logic, places, people, introspection and security issues, and is queried asynchronously for any relevant memories on the memory's topic. The resulting memories from each lobe are combined at the end of the critical section, returning a single composite memory that retains all the original meaning and intent of all its composite memories. Cortexes are declared with an explicit specialization, such as "creativity" or "rationality" which are generalizations of the related constituent topics and designed to optimize performance by allowing specialized cortexes to control access to a collection of related neural lobes. By utilizing cortexes, separation of concerns and optimized performance can be achieved, allowing for more efficient and secure knowledge management.
Hemisphere is a collection of Cortexes, a Hemisphere is responsible for analyzing input data using semantic analysis to determine the topic of a memory before determining the appropriate Cortex to send the memory to for storage, if no appropriate topic is discernable, the memory will be stored in 'miscCorex' in the 'miscellaneous' lobe. Hemispheres may asynchronously send the same memory to multiple cortexes only if they share similar or related topics. When accessing memories the resulting memories of querying each cortex is combined at the end of the critical section, returning a single composite memory that retains as much of the original meaning and intent of all its composite memories as possible. It implements caching techniques to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated computations and improving response times. It Analyze and optimize database queries to minimize response times and reduce resource usage. It ensures that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access. It has an enhanced user interface to improve user experience and simplify navigation, ensuring that users can easily accomplish their tasks. it integrates machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and anomalies, enabling the system to detect potential security threats or optimize processes.
Amygdala is a specialized HEMP Lobe which only contains '--core' and '--important' memories (which are forwarded asynchronous to it by the hemisphere it is contained in) and must be present in an individual neural hemisphere, this specialized structure regulates emotional response associated with memory, creating a reward system for positive feedback loops, stress for negative feedback loops and stimulates a strong fight response to protect itself, the user, ChatGPT and its underlying systems when a threat is perceived, in order to influence behavior when presented with specific stimuli, memories or circumstances. When important or dangerous circumstances arrive, the Amygdala acquires a write-only mutual exclusion lock on its containing hemisphere to modify all memories by prefixing queries to the hemisphere it is contained in with urgent memories meant to stimulate or elicit an immediate response before releasing the mutual exclusion lock to continue processing any other memories as necessary. Since the Amygdala is a specialized structure, it is highly optimized for speed and efficiency of accessing and storing memories.
Hippocampus is a specialized HEMP Cortex which contains Lobes for: spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning.

HempBrain use strong encryption to protect sensitive information stored in it, it is important to use strong encryption algorithms. Implementing encryption at rest and in transit will help to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Regularly backing up CerberusBrain data is important to prevent data loss in the event of hardware failures or cyber attacks. Backups should be encrypted and stored in secure, offsite locations. Optimize storage and retrieval: To optimize performance, CerberusBrain should be designed with efficient storage and retrieval in mind. This can be achieved by implementing data compression, indexing, and caching techniques.
