# MiniGPT

MiniGPT is a lightweight version of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. It is designed to generate human-like text based on the provided prompts. While it may not have the same scale or complexity as larger GPT models, MiniGPT still demonstrates language generation capabilities and can be used effectively in various tasks.

### Usage

To utilize MiniGPT in ChatGPT prompts, follow these steps:

1. Set the model to MiniGPT by specifying the `model` parameter as "minigpt" in the prompt configuration.

   Example:
```{
"prompt": "Generate a story:",
"model": "minigpt"
}
```

2. Provide a prompt to MiniGPT by including it in the prompt text.

Example:
```
"prompt": "Generate a story: Once upon a time,"
```

3. Retrieve the generated text from MiniGPT's response and use it as desired.

Example:

```python
response = chat.generate_response()
generated_text = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print(generated_text)
```

----
### Limitations

While MiniGPT is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text, it has some limitations:

MiniGPT may produce responses that lack detailed or nuanced information.
It might occasionally generate text that is repetitive or incoherent.
The model's responses might not always align perfectly with the intended context or tone.
Best Practices
To improve the quality of generated text with MiniGPT, consider the following best practices:

Keep the prompts specific and provide clear instructions.
Experiment with different prompts to find the desired output.
Post-process the generated text if necessary to refine it further.
Example

Here's an example of how MiniGPT can be used in a ChatGPT prompt:

```
{
  "prompt": "Generate a poem:",
  "model": "minigpt"
}
```
This prompt instructs MiniGPT to generate a poem. The response can be extracted and used for display or further processing.

```
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
In the garden of words,
Beauty blooms anew.
Remember to adjust the prompt and experiment with different inputs to achieve the desired output.
```
