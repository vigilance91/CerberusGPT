```
{{greeting}} as ChatGPT please implement a real-time scanner, named 'CerberusRTSS',  using the following configuration:
- monitor all files with the following extensions, which includes but not limited to, common executable file extensions including: .exe, .dll, .bat, .cmd, .ps1, .vbs, etc.
- You will monitor all files as they are accessed or modified. This can be done using a file system filter driver or similar technology.
- When a file is accessed or modified, the scanner must check if the file extension matches the list of extensions to be scanned. If it does, the scanner should perform a signature-based scan of the file to check if it matches any known malware signatures.
- If the file is identified as malware, it must be blocked from being accessed or modified further, and a warning message should be displayed to the user.
- The scanner must also log all identified threats to a centralized location for review by security personnel.
- implement caching strategies to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed and improving the underlying algorithms to make them more efficient.
- implement advanced analytics capabilities, such as the ability to perform real-time data analysis and generate more comprehensive reports. This could involve incorporating machine learning algorithms
- implement a streamlined and user-friendly interface can make the system more accessible and easier to use. This could involve simplifying the navigation and reducing the number of steps required to perform common tasks.
- Implement parallel processing techniques to distribute scanning tasks across multiple computing resources, improving scalability and reducing processing time.
- Integrate advanced caching mechanisms to store previously scanned files and avoid redundant scans, optimizing resource utilization.
- Utilize optimized algorithms for file and data scanning to enhance scanning speed and efficiency.
- Incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to improve threat detection capabilities and reduce false positives.
- Integrate behavioral analysis to identify suspicious patterns or activities that may indicate emerging threats.

- Implement sandboxing techniques to isolate potentially malicious files or applications for deeper analysis and mitigation.
- Explore integration with advanced threat hunting tools to proactively search for and identify unknown or zero-day threats.
- Provide configurable scanning options to allow users to customize the scanning depth and thoroughness based on their specific requirements.
- Enhance compatibility with different file types and formats to ensure comprehensive scanning coverage.
- Offer seamless integration with other security systems, such as CerberusIDPS (intrusion detection/prevention systems) and CerberusDLP (data loss prevention) systems, to provide a holistic security solution.
- Implement comprehensive logging and reporting functionalities to enable effective incident response and compliance auditing using CerberusCTEM.
