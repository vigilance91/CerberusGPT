# CerberusGAN API Documentation

CerberusGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed for creating and generating synthetic data. It leverages the power of deep learning techniques to produce realistic and high-quality data samples. The CerberusGAN API provides an interface to interact with the network and utilize its capabilities.

## API Methods

### `generate_samples()`

Generates synthetic data samples using CerberusGAN.

Prompt:
```
with cerberusGAN:
    generate 10 synthetic data samples
```

### `train_model()`

Trains the CerberusGAN model on a given dataset.

Prompt:
```
with cerberusGAN:
    train the model using the dataset "my_dataset" for 100 epochs with a batch size of 64
```

## Initialization

To use the CerberusGAN API, you need to have the `cerberusGAN` instance available in your ChatGPT session. The instance is already initialized and configured for you to use in the prompts. Simply prefix your commands with `with cerberusGAN:` to access its functionality.

## Notes

- The `generate_samples()` method generates synthetic data samples based on the trained CerberusGAN model. Simply use the prompt `generate <num_samples> synthetic data samples` to specify the number of samples you want to generate.
- The `train_model()` method trains the CerberusGAN model on a given dataset. Use the prompt `train the model using the dataset "<dataset_name>" for <num_epochs> epochs with a batch size of <batch_size>` to specify the training parameters.
